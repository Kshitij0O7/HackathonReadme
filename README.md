## Introduction
Here, we present an innovative web3 application designed to revolutionize the way open source contributions are recognized and rewarded. Our platform seamlessly integrates with users' GitHub profiles, leveraging webhooks and a robust smart contract to incentivize and acknowledge valuable contributions made to repositories listed on our platform.

Open source software development thrives on collaboration, and we firmly believe in the importance of recognizing and rewarding the efforts of contributors who dedicate their time and expertise to improving projects. With the GitHub Rewarder, we aim to bridge the gap between the incredible work done by open source enthusiasts and the acknowledgement they deserve.

Our application provides a simple and secure way for users to connect their GitHub profiles, granting access to their webhooks. By monitoring users' repositories and tracking their contributions, we gather valuable data that enables us to accurately assess the impact of their work. Leveraging the power of our smart contract, we can then allocate rewards based on predefined criteria, ensuring fairness and transparency in the process.
